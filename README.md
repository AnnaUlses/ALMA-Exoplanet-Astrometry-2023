# ALMA Band 7 Astrometry
ast_pars_149 = minimum planet mass & semi-major axis, astrometric accuracy/signature
brighter3mag_photometry = fitted photometry parameters for larger sample of 223 (before cuts were made on declinations)
converted_mags = all of Hipparcos DR2 magnitudes converted to Gaia passband
hip_data_149 = Hipparcos DR2 parameters for final sample of 149 stars
observable_sample = fitted photometry parameters for observable sample 
resolved_stars = stars in this sample which are resolved by ALMA in band 7
sample_names = just a list of the Hipparcos ID's for this sample
sensitivity_alma = calculated sensitivies for all 8 ALMA bands for 15 and 60 minutes integration times
snr_alma = snr in each ALMA band for each star in sample 
stellar_distances = distance to stars in sample, can be calculated from Hipparcos DR2 parallax values 
unresolved_stars = stars which remain unresolved
